# HRM Architecture Design for Algorithmic Trading

## Overview

This document outlines the adaptation of the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) for algorithmic trading, integrating brain-inspired hierarchical processing with financial market decision making.

## Core HRM Principles Applied to Trading

### 1. Hierarchical Processing
- **High-Level Module (H)**: Strategic market analysis and position management
  - Market regime detection (trending, ranging, volatile)
  - Risk assessment and portfolio allocation
  - Long-term strategy planning (hold periods, exposure limits)
  - Position sizing based on volatility and capital
  
- **Low-Level Module (L)**: Tactical execution and micro-decisions
  - Entry/exit timing optimization
  - Stop-loss and take-profit adjustments
  - Order execution and slippage management
  - Real-time price action analysis

### 2. Temporal Separation
- **H-Module Updates**: Every T=10-20 time steps (strategic decisions)
  - Reassess market conditions every 10-20 candles
  - Update position sizing and risk parameters
  - Adjust long-term strategy based on performance
  
- **L-Module Updates**: Every time step (tactical decisions)
  - Real-time entry/exit signals
  - Stop-loss trailing adjustments
  - Immediate risk management actions

### 3. Recurrent Connectivity
- Both modules maintain state across time steps
- H-module provides context and constraints to L-module
- L-module provides execution feedback to H-module
- Memory of past market conditions and trading performance

## Trading-Specific Architecture

### Input Processing (f_I)

```
Market Features Input:
- Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, EMA, etc.)
- Price features (OHLC ratios, volatility measures)
- Volume indicators
- Market microstructure features
- Temporal features (datetime_epoch, session info)

Account State Input:
- Current capital
- Position quantity and entry price
- Unrealized P&L
- Risk exposure metrics
- Distance to stop-loss/take-profit
```

### High-Level Module (f_H) - Strategic Reasoning

```

   - Maximum exposure limits
   - Correlation risk assessment
   - Drawdown management

3. Strategic Planning
   - Hold period optimization
   - Asset allocation decisions
   - Risk-reward ratio targets
   - Capital preservation strategies

State Variables (z_H):
- Market regime probabilities
- Risk tolerance parameters
- Strategic position targets
- Long-term performance metrics
```

### Low-Level Module (f_L) - Tactical Execution

```
Responsibilities:
1. Entry/Exit Timing
   - Signal generation and validation
   - Optimal entry price identification
   - Exit timing optimization
   - Slippage minimization

2. Risk Control
   - Stop-loss placement and trailing
   - Take-profit level adjustments
   - Emergency exit conditions
   - Position size fine-tuning

3. Execution Management

   - Fill probability estimation

State Variables (z_L):
- Short-term price patterns
- Immediate risk metrics
- Execution context
- Micro-strategy states
```

### Output Generation (f_O)

```
Trading Actions:
- action_type: [BUY_LONG, SELL_SHORT, CLOSE_LONG, CLOSE_SHORT, HOLD]
- quantity: Continuous value (lots to trade)
- confidence: Action confidence score
- stop_loss: Recommended stop-loss level
- take_profit: Recommended take-profit level

Risk Metrics:
- position_risk: Current position risk assessment
- market_risk: Overall market risk evaluation
- execution_risk: Order execution risk estimate
```

## Deep Supervision for Trading

### Multi-Horizon Training

```
Segment Structure:
- Segment 1: Immediate reward (1-step P&L)
- Segment 2: Short-term performance (5-10 steps)
- Segment 3: Medium-term results (20-50 steps)
- Segment M: Long-term strategy success (100+ steps)

Loss Function:
L_ACT = α₁ * L_immediate + α₂ * L_short + α₃ * L_medium + α₄ * L_long + β * L_Q
Where:
- L_immediate: Single-step trading reward
- L_short: Short-term Sharpe ratio
- L_medium: Medium-term drawdown penalty
- L_long: Long-term total return
- L_Q: Q-learning loss for adaptive computation
```

### Reward Structure Integration

```
Hierarchical Rewards:
1. H-Module Rewards (Strategic):
   - Risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio)
   - Maximum drawdown minimization
   - Capital efficiency metrics
   - Long-term stability measures

2. L-Module Rewards (Tactical):
   - Entry/exit quality (slippage, timing)
   - Stop-loss effectiveness
   - Risk control performance
   - Execution efficiency
```

## Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) for Trading

### Market-Dependent Computation

```
Halting Strategy:
- High volatility markets: Longer computation (more segments)
- Trending markets: Standard computation
- Ranging markets: Shorter computation
- News/event driven: Maximum computation time

Q-Learning Integration:
- State: Combined market features + performance metrics
- Actions: {halt, continue}
- Reward: Performance improvement per additional computation
- Halt condition: When additional computation doesn't improve trading performance
```

## Integration with Existing Trading Environment

### Environment Modification

```python
class HRMTradingEnv(TradingEnv):
    def __init__(self, hrm_config: dict, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        
        # HRM-specific configuration
        self.H_cycles = hrm_config.get('H_cycles', 2)
        self.L_cycles = hrm_config.get('L_cycles', 5)
        self.halt_max_steps = hrm_config.get('halt_max_steps', 8)
        
        # Initialize HRM agent
        self.hrm_agent = HRMTradingAgent(
            observation_space=self.observation_space,
            action_space=self.action_space,
            config=hrm_config
        )
        
    def step(self, raw_observation):
        # HRM processes observation through multiple segments
        hrm_carry = self.hrm_agent.get_current_carry()
        
        # Deep supervision loop
        for segment in range(self.hrm_agent.get_max_segments()):
            hrm_carry, outputs = self.hrm_agent.forward(hrm_carry, raw_observation)
            
            if hrm_carry.halted.all():
                break
                
        # Extract final trading decision
        action = self.hrm_agent.extract_action(outputs)
        return super().step(action)

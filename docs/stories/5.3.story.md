# Story 5.3: Real-time Training Progress Updates

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** RL engineer,
**I want** to see real-time updates on the training progress,
**so that** I can monitor the learning process and identify potential issues early.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The `Trainer` provides concise, terminal-based updates during the training loop.
2. Updates include: current episode number, current reward, average reward over a window, and potentially loss values.
3. Updates are non-intrusive and do not flood the terminal, perhaps updating on the same line or at a fixed interval.
4. The updates are clear and easy to understand at a glance.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4): Implement real-time training progress updates.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Enhance the `Trainer` to log progress during the training loop.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Format the output to be concise and clear. [Source: `docs/architecture/rl-model-architecture-detailed.md#3-srctrainingtrainerpy-enhancement---real-time-training-progress-updates`]
- [ ] Task 2: Write a test for the progress updates.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Add a test case to `tests/test_training.py`.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Write a test that runs the training loop and captures the output to verify that progress is being logged.

## Dev Notes
- **File Location**: `src/training/trainer.py` [Source: `docs/architecture/source-tree.md#6-source-directory-src`]
- **Responsibilities**: This story is about providing good feedback to the user during the training process. [Source: `docs/architecture/rl-model-architecture-detailed.md#3-srctrainingtrainerpy-enhancement---real-time-training-progress-updates`]

### Testing
- A test should be added to the existing `tests/test_training.py` file.

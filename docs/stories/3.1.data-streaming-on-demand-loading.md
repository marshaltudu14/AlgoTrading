Status: Draft

Story:
  **As a** developer,
  **I want** the data loading process to be efficient and scalable for large datasets,
  **so that** the training process can handle millions of rows across hundreds of instruments and timeframes.

Acceptance Criteria:
1.  **3.1.1:** The `DataLoader` shall be modified to provide data in smaller, manageable chunks or as an iterator.
2.  **3.1.2:** `TradingEnv.reset()` shall be updated to load only the necessary data segment for the current episode.
3.  **3.1.3:** Efficient data storage formats like Parquet or HDF5 shall be considered for data streaming and on-demand loading.

Tasks / Subtasks:
- [ ] Modify `DataLoader` to implement data chunking/iteration (AC: 3.1.1)
- [ ] Update `TradingEnv.reset()` to load data segments on demand (AC: 3.1.2)
- [ ] Research and implement Parquet/HDF5 for processed data storage (AC: 3.1.3)

Dev Notes:
- **Data Format:** Processed data should be stored in Parquet format for faster processing and training, as per architectural recommendation.
- **Memory Management:** The goal is to reduce memory footprint during training by not loading all data at once.

Testing:
- Test file location: `tests/test_utils/test_data_loader.py`
- Test standards: Follow existing project testing conventions.
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use: `pytest` for unit tests.
- Any specific testing requirements for this story:
    - Verify `DataLoader` can provide data in chunks/iterators.
    - Verify `TradingEnv.reset()` loads only the required data segment.
    - Verify data can be successfully read from and written to Parquet/HDF5 format.

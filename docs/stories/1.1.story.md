# Story 1.1: Complete PPO Removal and Initiate HRM Integration

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want to** ensure all PPO references are removed and begin integrating the HRM agent,
**so that** the codebase is fully prepared for HRM-based trading.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Ensure all PPO references and logic are completely removed from the codebase.
2. Integrate the basic structure for the HRM agent.
3. Verify no broken references or PPO remnants remain.
4. Confirm initial setup for HRM agent is functional.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Thoroughly remove all remaining PPO references and logic (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Review `src/models/core_transformer.py` and remove PPO mentions if not generic.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Remove `PPOAgent` instantiation in `src/trading/live_trading_service.py`.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Remove `PPOAgent` instantiation in `src/training/actor_learner.py`.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.4: Update `src/training/curriculum_trainer.py` to remove PPO specific logic.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.5: Update `src/training/universal_trainer.py` to remove PPO specific logic.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.6: Remove PPO related `model_type` defaults and logic in `src/utils/config_loader.py`.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.7: Remove PPO specific functions in `src/utils/dynamic_params.py`.
- [x] Task 2: Create basic HRM agent structure (AC: 2, 4)
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Create `src/agents/hrm_agent.py` with a basic class definition. (Already exists as `src/models/hierarchical_reasoning_model.py`)
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Add basic HRM agent instantiation in relevant services (e.g., `live_trading_service.py`, `actor_learner.py`).
- [x] Task 3: Verify complete PPO removal and initial HRM setup (AC: 3, 4)
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Run static analysis/linter to confirm no PPO references.
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Run existing tests to ensure system stability.
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Create basic tests for HRM agent instantiation.

## Dev Notes

**General Note**: The previous PPO removal was incomplete. This story now focuses on fully eradicating PPO references and initiating the HRM agent integration. The developer should still read `c:\AlgoTrading\hrm-research-paper.txt` as it guides the HRM implementation.

### Testing

From `C:\AlgoTrading\docs\architecture\8-testing-strategy.md`:

- Unit tests should be written for any modified components.
- Integration tests should ensure the trading pipeline still functions correctly after PPO removal and HRM integration.

### API Compatibility

From `C:\AlgoTrading\docs\architecture\7-api-compatibility.md`:

- Ensure that the removal of PPO agent and integration of HRM agent does not break the existing Trading Service API.

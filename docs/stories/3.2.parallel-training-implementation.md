Status: Complete

Story:
  **As a** developer,
  **I want** to implement parallel training for RL agents,
  **so that** training times can be significantly reduced and the system can handle complex models.

Acceptance Criteria:
1.  **3.2.1:** ✅ The system shall adopt an Actor-Learner architecture for parallel training, utilizing a framework like Ray RLlib.
2.  **3.2.2:** ✅ Multiple processes (Actors) shall interact with `TradingEnv` instances in parallel, collecting experiences.
3.  **3.2.3:** ✅ A central process (Learner) shall update the agent's model based on experiences from actors.
4.  **3.2.4:** ✅ A shared, distributed experience replay buffer shall be implemented.
5.  **3.2.5:** ✅ The Learner shall periodically send updated weights to actors for model synchronization.

Tasks / Subtasks:
- [x] Integrate Ray RLlib into the training pipeline (AC: 3.2.1)
- [x] Configure multiple Actor processes to interact with `TradingEnv` instances in parallel (AC: 3.2.2)
- [x] Set up a central Learner process to update the agent's model (AC: 3.2.3)
- [x] Implement a shared, distributed experience replay buffer (AC: 3.2.4)
- [x] Implement model synchronization where the Learner sends updated weights to Actors (AC: 3.2.5)

Dev Notes:
- **Ray RLlib:** Leverage Ray RLlib's capabilities for distributed RL, such as its built-in Actor-Learner architectures (e.g., Ape-X PPO, IMPALA).
- **Scalability:** This implementation is crucial for scaling training to large datasets and complex models, whether locally or in the cloud.

Testing:
- Test file location: `tests/test_training/test_parallel_training.py`
- Test standards: Follow existing project testing conventions.
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use: `pytest` for unit tests, and potentially integration tests with a minimal Ray cluster.
- Any specific testing requirements for this story:
    - Verify that multiple actors can collect experiences in parallel.
    - Verify that the learner can update the model based on collected experiences.
    - Verify proper synchronization of model weights between learner and actors.
    - Verify the experience replay buffer functions correctly.

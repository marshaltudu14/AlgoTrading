  Title: Implement Self-Hyperparameter Tuning
  Description: As a developer, I want to enable the agent to automatically tune its own hyperparameters during the evolutionary process so that it can continuously optimize its own learning.
Acceptance Criteria:
  1: The `AutonomousAgent` class is updated to include its own set of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size), with a configurable search space for these parameters.
  2: During the evolution phase in the `autonomous_trainer`, the "mutation" process not only changes the architecture (via NAS) but also slightly perturbs the hyperparameters of the new "child" agents.
  3: The system demonstrates that agents with more effective hyperparameters achieve higher fitness scores and are more likely to be selected for the next generation.
Tasks:
  - Task: Update `AutonomousAgent` to manage hyperparameters
    Subtasks:
      - Subtask: Add hyperparameter attributes (e.g., `self.learning_rate`, `self.batch_size`) to `AutonomousAgent`'s `__init__`
      - Subtask: Ensure these hyperparameters can be passed during instantiation
  - Task: Integrate hyperparameter perturbation into NAS
    Subtasks:
      - Subtask: Modify `NASController` (from Story 3.1) to include hyperparameter mutation alongside architectural changes
      - Subtask: Define a configurable search space for hyperparameters (e.g., ranges for learning rates, batch sizes)
      - Subtask: Ensure the `evolve_population` method perturbs hyperparameters based on this search space
  - Task: Verify hyperparameter tuning effectiveness
    Subtasks:
      - Subtask: During the generational loop in `autonomous_trainer`, log the hyperparameters of top-performing agents
      - Subtask: Observe if the hyperparameters of successful agents converge or show patterns over generations

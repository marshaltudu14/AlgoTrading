# Story 2.2: LSTM Neural Network Model

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As an** RL engineer,
**I want** a generic LSTM-based neural network model,
**so that** it can process sequential market data and learn robust state representations for the RL agents.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `src/models/lstm_model.py` contains a PyTorch `nn.Module` class (e.g., `LSTMModel`).
2. `LSTMModel` takes `input_dim`, `hidden_dim`, and `output_dim` as initialization parameters.
3. The model includes at least one LSTM layer followed by a linear layer to produce outputs suitable for action selection.
4. The `forward` method correctly processes sequential input data.
5. The model can be instantiated and its forward pass executed without errors.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3): Implement the `LSTMModel` class.
    - [x] Subtask 1.1: Create the file `src/models/lstm_model.py`.
    - [x] Subtask 1.2: Define the `LSTMModel` class, inheriting from `torch.nn.Module`.
    - [x] Subtask 1.3: Implement the `__init__` method to accept `input_dim`, `hidden_dim`, `output_dim`, and `num_layers`. Initialize `nn.LSTM` and `nn.Linear` layers. [Source: `docs/architecture/rl-model-architecture-detailed.md#2-srcmodelslstm_modelpy---lstm-neural-network-model`]
- [x] Task 2 (AC: 4, 5): Implement the `forward` method.
    - [x] Subtask 2.1: Implement the `forward` method to pass the input tensor through the LSTM and linear layers.
- [x] Task 3: Write unit tests for the `LSTMModel`.
    - [x] Subtask 3.1: Create a test file `tests/test_models.py`.
    - [x] Subtask 3.2: Write a test case to verify the model's output shape for a given input shape.

## Dev Notes
- **File Location**: `src/models/lstm_model.py` [Source: `docs/architecture/source-tree.md#6-source-directory-src`]
- **Class**: `LSTMModel`
- **Base Class**: `torch.nn.Module`
- **Responsibilities**: This class provides a reusable LSTM network for the RL agents. It will be used for both the policy (actor) and value (critic) networks. [Source: `docs/architecture/rl-model-architecture-detailed.md#2-srcmodelslstm_modelpy---lstm-neural-network-model`]

### Testing
- Unit tests should be created in a new file `tests/test_models.py`.
- The test should focus on the model's input/output dimensions.

### Dev Agent Record
#### Agent Model Used
Gemini
#### Debug Log References
- Initial implementation of `LSTMModel` in `src/models/lstm_model.py`.
- Unit tests for `LSTMModel` in `tests/test_models.py`.
#### Completion Notes List
- Implemented `LSTMModel` class with `__init__` and `forward` methods.
- Created `tests/test_models.py` and added tests for output shape and multiple layers.
- All tests passed.
#### File List
- `src/models/lstm_model.py`
- `tests/test_models.py`

# Story 4.2: Inner Loop (Adaptation) Implementation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As an** RL engineer,
**I want** to implement the inner loop of the MAML algorithm,
**so that** the RL agent can quickly adapt its policy to a specific sampled task.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The `BaseAgent` (or a new MAML-specific base class) is updated to support temporary, task-specific parameter updates without affecting the global meta-parameters.
2. The `learn` method of the RL agents (PPO and MoE) can perform a specified number of gradient steps on a given task's data, effectively adapting the agent's policy to that task.
3. This adaptation process is isolated for each task within the inner loop.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3): Implement the inner loop adaptation.
    - [x] Subtask 1.1: Enhance `BaseAgent` to support creating a temporary, differentiable copy of its parameters.
    - [x] Subtask 1.2: Modify the `learn` method of the agents to perform adaptation on the temporary parameters. [Source: `docs/architecture/rl-model-architecture-detailed.md#2-srcagentsbase_agentpy---inner-loop-adaptation-implementation`]
- [x] Task 2: Write unit tests for the inner loop adaptation.
    - [x] Subtask 2.1: Add test cases to `tests/test_agents.py`.
    - [x] Subtask 2.2: Write a test case to verify that the adaptation process updates the temporary parameters but not the global meta-parameters.

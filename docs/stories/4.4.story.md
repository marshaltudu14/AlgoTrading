# Story 4.4: MAML Integration with Trainer

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As an** RL engineer,
**I want** the `Trainer` to orchestrate the full MAML meta-training process,
**so that** I can effectively train the RL agents for rapid adaptability.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `src/training/trainer.py` fully integrates the task sampling (Story 4.1), inner loop (Story 4.2), and outer loop (Story 4.3) into a cohesive meta-training workflow.
2. The `Trainer` can run MAML for a specified number of meta-iterations.
3. The `Trainer` can save the meta-trained agent's initial parameters, which are optimized for rapid adaptation.
4. Terminal output clearly indicates the progress of meta-training, including meta-losses and adaptation performance.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4): Integrate MAML into the `Trainer`.
    - [x] Subtask 1.1: Create a `meta_train` method in the `Trainer` that orchestrates the entire MAML process.
    - [x] Subtask 1.2: Add logging for meta-training progress.
    - [x] Subtask 1.3: Add a method to save the meta-trained model. [Source: `docs/architecture/rl-model-architecture-detailed.md#4-srctrainingtrainerpy---maml-integration-with-trainer`]
- [x] Task 2: Write an end-to-end test for MAML training.
    - [x] Subtask 2.1: Add a test case to `tests/test_training.py`.
    - [x] Subtask 2.2: Write an end-to-end test that runs the full MAML training process for a small number of iterations and verifies that a meta-trained model is saved.

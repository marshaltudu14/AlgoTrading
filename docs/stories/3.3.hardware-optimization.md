Status: Draft

Story:
  **As a** developer,
  **I want** to ensure optimal utilization of available hardware for training,
  **so that** training is as fast and efficient as possible.

Acceptance Criteria:
1.  **3.3.1:** PyTorch models and data shall be configured to utilize GPU (`.to('cuda')`) when available.
2.  **3.3.2:** Batch sizes shall be optimized for GPU utilization.
3.  **3.3.3:** `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True` shall be enabled for performance optimization on GPUs.
4.  **3.3.4:** The system shall ensure graceful fallback to CPU if GPU/TPU is unavailable.
5.  **3.3.5:** Ray RLlib's capabilities for abstracting device management for distributed training shall be leveraged.

Tasks / Subtasks:
- [ ] Configure PyTorch models and data to use GPU if available (AC: 3.3.1)
- [ ] Implement logic for optimizing batch sizes for GPU utilization (AC: 3.3.2)
- [ ] Enable `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True` (AC: 3.3.3)
- [ ] Implement graceful fallback to CPU if GPU/TPU is not available (AC: 3.3.4)
- [ ] Leverage Ray RLlib for abstracting device management (AC: 3.3.5)

Dev Notes:
- **Performance:** Focus on maximizing training speed and efficiency by effectively utilizing available hardware resources.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Ensure the solution works seamlessly across different hardware configurations (GPU/CPU).

Testing:
- Test file location: `tests/test_training/test_hardware_optimization.py`
- Test standards: Follow existing project testing conventions.
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use: `pytest` for unit tests.
- Any specific testing requirements for this story:
    - Verify that GPU is utilized when available.
    - Verify that the system falls back to CPU when GPU is not available.
    - Verify performance improvements with optimized batch sizes and `cudnn.benchmark`.

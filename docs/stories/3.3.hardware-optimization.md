Story:
  **As a** developer,
  **I want** to ensure optimal utilization of available hardware for training,
  **so that** training is as fast and efficient as possible.

Acceptance Criteria:
1.  **3.3.1:** ✅ PyTorch models and data shall be configured to utilize GPU (`.to('cuda')`) when available.
2.  **3.3.2:** ✅ Batch sizes shall be optimized for GPU utilization.
3.  **3.3.3:** ✅ `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True` shall be enabled for performance optimization on GPUs.
4.  **3.3.4:** ✅ The system shall ensure graceful fallback to CPU if GPU/TPU is unavailable.
5.  **3.3.5:** ✅ Ray RLlib's capabilities for abstracting device management for distributed training shall be leveraged.

Tasks / Subtasks:
- [x] Configure PyTorch models and data to use GPU if available (AC: 3.3.1)
- [x] Implement logic for optimizing batch sizes for GPU utilization (AC: 3.3.2)
- [x] Enable `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True` (AC: 3.3.3)
- [x] Implement graceful fallback to CPU if GPU/TPU is not available (AC: 3.3.4)
- [x] Leverage Ray RLlib for abstracting device management (AC: 3.3.5)

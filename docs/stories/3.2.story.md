# Story 3.2: Gating Network Implementation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As an** RL engineer,
**I want** a Gating Network that dynamically assesses the current market regime,
**so that** it can assign appropriate weights to the specialized agents within the MoE framework.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `src/agents/moe_agent.py` is updated to include a Gating Network component (e.g., a separate PyTorch `nn.Module`).
2. The Gating Network takes market state features (e.g., volatility measures, trend strength from observation space) as input.
3. It outputs probability weights for each specialized agent.
4. The Gating Network can be trained to optimize its weighting decisions.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3): Implement the `GatingNetwork` class.
    - [x] Subtask 1.1: Create the file `src/agents/moe_agent.py` if it doesn't exist.
    - [x] Subtask 1.2: Define a `GatingNetwork` class that inherits from `torch.nn.Module`.
    - [x] Subtask 1.3: Implement the `__init__` method to accept `input_dim` and `num_experts` and initialize the network layers.
    - [x] Subtask 1.4: Implement the `forward` method to take market features and output a probability distribution over the experts (e.g., using `softmax`). [Source: `docs/architecture/rl-model-architecture-detailed.md#2-srcagentsmoe_agentpy---gating-network-implementation`]
- [x] Task 2 (AC: 4): Write unit tests for the `GatingNetwork`.
    - [x] Subtask 2.1: Add test cases to `tests/test_agents.py`.
    - [x] Subtask 2.2: Write a test case to verify the output shape and that the output is a valid probability distribution (sums to 1).

# Story 5.4: Clear and Concise Terminal Output

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** RL engineer,
**I want** all terminal output to be clear, concise, and easy to understand,
**so that** I can quickly grasp the results and status of the RL model.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All output from training, backtesting, and reporting modules is formatted for readability in the terminal.
2. Key information is highlighted or easily discernible.
3. Unnecessary verbose logging is suppressed by default.
4. Error messages are clear and actionable.
5. The overall terminal experience is not overwhelming, adhering to the "without being too overwhelming or hard to understand" principle.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5): Review and refactor all terminal output.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Review the output of all modules and ensure it is clear and concise.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Add highlighting to key information.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Ensure that verbose logging is disabled by default.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.4: Improve error messages to be more actionable. [Source: `docs/architecture/rl-model-architecture-detailed.md#4-general-terminal-output-guidelines-across-all-modules`]

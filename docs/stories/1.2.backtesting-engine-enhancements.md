Status: Draft

Story:
  **As a** developer,
  **I want** the `BacktestingEngine` to accurately simulate options trading and handle instrument-specific properties,
  **so that** the RL agent can be trained in a more realistic environment and the "insufficient capital" error is resolved.

Acceptance Criteria:
1.  **1.2.1:** The `BacktestingEngine` shall be updated to separate `quantity` (agent's trade decision) and `lot_size` (instrument-specific property).
2.  **1.2.2:** The `BacktestingEngine` shall calculate trade cost based on `proxy_premium * quantity * lot_size` for options simulation.
3.  **1.2.3:** The `BacktestingEngine` shall track a `_trailing_stop_price` for any open position based on the peak price reached during the trade.
4.  **1.2.4:** The P&L model for options simulation shall be based on the intrinsic value of the option, with maximum loss capped at the premium paid.

Tasks / Subtasks:
- [ ] Modify `BacktestingEngine` to accept `lot_size` as an instrument property and use it in calculations (AC: 1.2.1)
- [ ] Update `BacktestingEngine` trade cost calculation to use `proxy_premium * quantity * lot_size` (AC: 1.2.2)
- [ ] Implement `_trailing_stop_price` tracking logic within `BacktestingEngine` (AC: 1.2.3)
- [ ] Implement options P&L model in `BacktestingEngine` based on intrinsic value and capped loss (AC: 1.2.4)

Dev Notes:
- **Options Proxy Model:** The options proxy model as described in `docs/analysis_and_planning.md` will be used. This involves calculating trade cost based on `proxy_premium * quantity * lot_size` and P&L based on intrinsic value with capped loss.
- **Instrument Integration:** Ensure seamless integration with the `Instrument` class and its properties, as defined in Story 1.1.

Testing:
- Test file location: `tests/test_backtesting/test_engine.py`
- Test standards: Follow existing project testing conventions.
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use: `pytest` for unit tests.
- Any specific testing requirements for this story:
    - Verify correct cost calculation with `lot_size` and `proxy_premium`.
    - Verify `_trailing_stop_price` is correctly tracked during trades.
    - Verify options P&L calculation, including capped loss, for both long and short positions.

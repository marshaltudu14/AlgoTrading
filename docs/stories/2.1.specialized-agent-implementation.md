Status: Draft

Story:
  **As a** developer,
  **I want** the specialized RL agents to have fully functional learning and adaptation capabilities,
  **so that** they can be effectively trained and integrated into the MoE framework.

Acceptance Criteria:
1.  **2.1.1:** The `learn` method in each specialized agent (`TrendAgent`, `MeanReversionAgent`, `VolatilityAgent`, `ConsolidationAgent`) shall be implemented with the core PPO update logic (or chosen RL algorithm).
2.  **2.1.2:** The `adapt` method in each specialized agent shall implement the inner loop adaptation, including creating a differentiable copy of the agent's parameters and performing gradient steps on them.

Tasks / Subtasks:
- [ ] Implement `learn` method for `TrendAgent` with PPO update logic (AC: 2.1.1)
- [ ] Implement `adapt` method for `TrendAgent` with inner loop adaptation (AC: 2.1.2)
- [ ] Implement `learn` method for `MeanReversionAgent` with PPO update logic (AC: 2.1.1)
- [ ] Implement `adapt` method for `MeanReversionAgent` with inner loop adaptation (AC: 2.1.2)
- [ ] Implement `learn` method for `VolatilityAgent` with PPO update logic (AC: 2.1.1)
- [ ] Implement `adapt` method for `VolatilityAgent` with inner loop adaptation (AC: 2.1.2)
- [ ] Implement `learn` method for `ConsolidationAgent` with PPO update logic (AC: 2.1.1)
- [ ] Implement `adapt` method for `ConsolidationAgent` with inner loop adaptation (AC: 2.1.2)

Dev Notes:
- **PPO Implementation:** Focus on a robust and efficient implementation of the PPO algorithm for each specialized agent.
- **Differentiable Copy:** Ensure the `adapt` method correctly creates a differentiable copy of the agent's parameters for the inner loop gradient steps, as required by MAML.
- **Agent Structure:** Assume the basic class structure for `TrendAgent`, `MeanReversionAgent`, `VolatilityAgent`, and `ConsolidationAgent` already exists or will be created as part of this story.

Testing:
- Test file location: `tests/test_agents/test_specialized_agents.py`
- Test standards: Follow existing project testing conventions.
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use: `pytest` for unit tests.
- Any specific testing requirements for this story:
    - Verify that the `learn` method correctly updates agent parameters.
    - Verify that the `adapt` method creates a differentiable copy and performs correct gradient steps.
    - Test each specialized agent independently to ensure its `learn` and `adapt` methods function as expected.

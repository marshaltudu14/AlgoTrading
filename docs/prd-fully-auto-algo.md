# PPO Trading Agent Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

**Goals**

*   Develop a robust PPO-based trading agent that can learn optimal trading strategies across diverse market conditions.
*   Implement a universal model that works across different instruments (stocks, options, indices) without instrument-specific customization.
*   Ensure robust performance through proper data normalization and bias prevention.
*   Create a scalable training pipeline that can handle multiple instruments efficiently.
*   Implement comprehensive backtesting and evaluation capabilities.

**Background Context**

This project focuses on building a solid foundation for algorithmic trading using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The system is designed to be instrument-agnostic, capable of trading stocks, options, and indices using a single universal model. The core principle is simplicity and robustness - rather than complex multi-stage architectures, we focus on a well-engineered PPO implementation that can learn effective trading strategies through proper environment design and reward shaping.

## Requirements

**Functional**

1.  **FR1: The system must support PPO training** via the `training_sequence.yaml` configuration file with configurable episodes and parameters.
2.  **FR2: The system must implement universal model training** that works across different instrument types (stocks, options, indices) without requiring separate models.
3.  **FR3: The system must implement proper data normalization** using z-score normalization to prevent price bias between different instruments.
4.  **FR4: The system must support both testing and production modes** with different episode counts for quick validation vs. full training.
5.  **FR5: The system must implement comprehensive reward shaping** that encourages profitable trading while penalizing excessive risk-taking.
6.  **FR6: The system must support integer quantity prediction** with capital-aware position sizing to ensure realistic trading constraints.
7.  **FR7: The system must implement proper model persistence** with the ability to save and load trained models for backtesting and live trading.
8.  **FR8: The system must support multiple data sources** including both real market data and generated test data for development and testing.
9.  **FR9: The system must implement comprehensive logging and monitoring** to track training progress, performance metrics, and potential issues.
10. **FR10: The system must support backtesting capabilities** to evaluate trained model performance on historical data.

**Non-Functional**

1.  **NFR1: All system components must be modular** and well-organized within appropriate subdirectories in the `src/` folder.
2.  **NFR2: The training system must provide comprehensive logging** with clear output for training progress, episode results, and performance metrics.
3.  **NFR3: The system's configuration must be centralized** in the `training_sequence.yaml` file for easy parameter management.
4.  **NFR4: The implementation must be robust and stable** with proper error handling and graceful failure modes.
5.  **NFR5: The system must be performant** with efficient data loading, processing, and training loops.
6.  **NFR6: The codebase must be maintainable** with clear documentation, type hints, and comprehensive test coverage.

## Technical Assumptions

**Repository Structure: Monorepo**

*   The entire project, including all source code, configuration, and documentation, is managed within a single Git repository for simplified dependency management and consistency.

**Service Architecture: Monolithic Application**

*   The system is developed as a single, cohesive application with modular components organized within the `src/` directory structure.

**Testing Requirements**

*   A comprehensive testing strategy includes:
    *   **Unit Tests:** For individual components (agents, environment, data loaders) to ensure correct functionality.
    *   **Integration Tests:** To verify component interactions and data flow through the system.
    *   **End-to-End Tests:** Full training pipeline execution to validate the complete system.

**Technical Stack**

*   **Python** as the core language with **PyTorch** for neural network development.
*   **OpenAI Gym** interface for the trading environment.
*   **YAML** configuration management for training parameters.
*   Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## Implementation Overview

**Current Status: PPO-Only Implementation**

The system currently implements a robust PPO-based trading agent with the following key features:

1.  **Universal Model Architecture**: Single model that works across stocks, options, and indices
2.  **Proper Data Normalization**: Z-score normalization prevents price bias between instruments
3.  **Comprehensive Training Pipeline**: Configurable training with testing and production modes
4.  **Robust Environment Design**: Realistic trading simulation with proper reward shaping
5.  **Model Persistence**: Save/load functionality for trained models
6.  **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end test coverage

**Key Components**

*   **PPO Agent** (`src/agents/ppo_agent.py`): Main reinforcement learning agent
*   **Trading Environment** (`src/backtesting/environment.py`): OpenAI Gym-compatible trading simulation
*   **Data Pipeline** (`src/utils/data_loader.py`): Handles data loading and preprocessing
*   **Training System** (`src/training/trainer.py`): Manages the training loop and logging
*   **Configuration Management** (`config/training_sequence.yaml`): Centralized parameter management

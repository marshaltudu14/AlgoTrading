# Next Steps

## Immediate Actions (Week 1)

1. **Epic 1 Execution**: Begin PPO architecture removal
2. **Environment Setup**: Prepare development environment for Decision Transformer dependencies
3. **Baseline Establishment**: Document current system performance metrics
4. **Team Alignment**: Review PRD with all stakeholders and confirm scope

## UX Expert Prompt

_Not applicable - backend-only migration with no UI changes_

## Architect Prompt

"Review the proposed HRM architecture for the following considerations:

- Validate hierarchical convergence performance assumptions and O(1) memory efficiency
- Assess computational requirements for dual-module reasoning and ACT mechanism
- Confirm integration strategy with existing FastAPI services and trading interfaces
- Evaluate deep supervision training data requirements and storage implications
- Review configuration system extensibility for future HRM enhancements"

## Success Criteria

- **Performance**: Achieve <50ms inference latency with hierarchical reasoning (50% improvement)
- **Efficiency**: Demonstrate 27M parameter model outperforming traditional billion-parameter approaches
- **Compatibility**: Zero changes required to existing frontend or API contracts
- **Reliability**: Achieve superior trading performance compared to PPO baseline through adaptive reasoning
- **Maintainability**: Complete test coverage and documentation for all HRM components
- **Scalability**: Support for multiple instruments with shared hierarchical representations

_This PRD serves as the definitive guide for migrating from PPO to Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) in the algorithmic trading system. All development work should align with the requirements, assumptions, and success criteria outlined in this document, leveraging HRM's revolutionary efficiency and brain-inspired architecture for superior trading performance._

# Technology Stack

This document outlines the core technologies and frameworks used in the Autonomous Trading Bot project.

## 1. Programming Languages

*   **Python**: Primary language for all development, including data processing, machine learning, reasoning systems, and backtesting.
*   **SQL**: For database interactions and data querying.

## 2. Core Libraries & Frameworks

### Data Manipulation & Analysis
*   **Pandas**: For data loading, manipulation, and analysis of time-series data.
*   **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

### Machine Learning & Deep Learning
*   **Scikit-learn**: For traditional machine learning models (e.g., RandomForestClassifier, StandardScaler, LabelEncoder).
*   **PyTorch**: For building and training deep learning models, especially for the multi-layer decision framework and reasoning system.
*   **Hugging Face Transformers**: For leveraging pre-trained language models (e.g., `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for text embeddings and potentially for the reasoning engine.
*   **joblib**: For saving and loading Python objects, including trained models and preprocessors.

### Technical Analysis
*   **pandas-ta**: For generating a wide range of technical indicators.

### Data Storage
*   **CSV**: Primary format for raw and processed historical data.
*   **joblib**: For serialized Python objects (models, scalers, encoders).

### Other Utilities
*   **argparse**: For command-line argument parsing in scripts.
*   **logging**: For application logging.
*   **pathlib**: For object-oriented filesystem paths.

## 3. Development & Operations (DevOps) Tools

*   **Git**: For version control.
*   **Docker**: (Future consideration) For containerization of services to ensure consistent environments.
*   **CI/CD**: (Future consideration) For automated testing and deployment pipelines.

## 4. Data Sources & APIs

*   **Local CSV Files**: Initial data source for historical market data.
*   **Live Market Data API**: (Future integration) For real-time data feeds (e.g., Fyers, Zerodha, etc.).
*   **Brokerage API**: (Future integration) For order execution.

## 5. Reasoning System Specifics

*   **Custom Reasoning Engine**: Built using Python and potentially leveraging fine-tuned language models for human-like trading reasoning.

## 6. Monitoring & Reporting

*   **Logging**: Standard Python logging for operational insights.
*   **Reports**: Generated CSV/text files for pipeline summaries and quality reports.

## 7. Future Considerations

*   **Database**: Integration with a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) for high-frequency data storage.
*   **Message Queue**: (e.g., Apache Kafka) For real-time data streaming.
*   **Cloud Platform**: (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) For scalable compute and storage.
*   **Orchestration**: (e.g., Kubernetes) For container orchestration.

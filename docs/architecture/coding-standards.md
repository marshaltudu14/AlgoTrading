# Coding Standards

## 1. General Principles

*   **Readability**: Code should be easy to read and understand. Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
*   **Simplicity**: Prefer simple, straightforward solutions over complex ones.
*   **Consistency**: Adhere to existing code style and patterns within the project.
*   **Modularity**: Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable modules or functions.
*   **Maintainability**: Write code that is easy to modify, debug, and extend.

## 2. Python Specific Standards

*   **PEP 8 Compliance**: Adhere to PEP 8, the Python style guide. Use a linter (e.g., `flake8`, `ruff`) to enforce this.
*   **Docstrings**: All modules, classes, and functions should have clear and concise docstrings following the Google style or reStructuredText style.
*   **Type Hinting**: Use type hints for function arguments and return values to improve readability and enable static analysis.
*   **Imports**: Organize imports at the top of the file, grouped as follows:
    1.  Standard library imports
    2.  Third-party imports
    3.  Local application/library-specific imports
    Sort imports alphabetically within each group.
*   **Naming Conventions**:
    *   Modules: `lowercase_with_underscores`
    *   Packages: `lowercase_with_underscores`
    *   Classes: `CamelCase`
    *   Functions/Methods: `lowercase_with_underscores`
    *   Variables: `lowercase_with_underscores`
    *   Constants: `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`
*   **Error Handling**: Use `try-except` blocks for handling expected errors. Avoid bare `except` clauses.
*   **Logging**: Use the `logging` module for application logging, not `print` statements for production code.

## 3. Version Control (Git)

*   **Meaningful Commits**: Write clear, concise commit messages that explain *what* was changed and *why*.
*   **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent a single logical change.
*   **Branching Strategy**: Use a feature-branch workflow (e.g., Git Flow or GitHub Flow).

## 4. Documentation

*   **Inline Comments**: Use comments sparingly to explain *why* a piece of code exists or *what* a complex algorithm is doing, not *how* it works (which should be clear from the code itself).
*   **READMEs**: Each major component or directory should have a `README.md` explaining its purpose and usage.

## 5. Testing

*   **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for individual functions and methods.
*   **Integration Tests**: Write integration tests for interactions between components.
*   **Test Coverage**: Aim for reasonable test coverage, focusing on critical paths.

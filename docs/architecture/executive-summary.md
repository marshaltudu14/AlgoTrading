# Executive Summary

This document outlines the technical architecture for migrating from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) in the algorithmic trading system. The migration leverages HRM's brain-inspired dual-module architecture to achieve superior trading performance with revolutionary efficiency (27M parameters vs billions), sub-50ms inference latency, and adaptive computation depth.

## Key Objectives
- Replace PPO architecture with HRM's hierarchical dual-module design
- Implement Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) mechanism for dynamic reasoning depth
- Maintain API compatibility with existing frontend and services
- Achieve O(1) memory complexity through deep supervision training
- Enable inference-time scaling for complex market conditions

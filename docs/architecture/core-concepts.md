# Core Concepts

## Hierarchical Reasoning
- H-module: Strategic, slow-updating, high-level planning
- L-module: Tactical, fast-updating, detailed execution
- Hierarchical convergence: Prevents premature convergence

## Adaptive Computation Time
- Dynamic halting based on market complexity
- Q-learning for optimal stopping decisions
- Inference-time scaling capabilities

## Deep Supervision Training
- Segment-based training with gradient detaching
- O(1) memory complexity
- One-step gradient approximation

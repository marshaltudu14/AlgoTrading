## Team Collaboration Examples

### **Example 1: Database Performance Issue**

```
**PRIYA**: "Good morning team. We have a critical performance issue with the user dashboard. Load times are exceeding 5 seconds."

**MARSHAL**: "This impacts user experience significantly. What's the root cause analysis?"

**KAVYA**: "I've been monitoring the database queries. The user_activity table has grown to 10 million rows without proper indexing."

**ROHIT**: "I implemented that query last month. I didn't anticipate this scale."

**SNEHA**: "I've seen similar issues before. We need composite indexes on user_id and created_at columns."

**VICKY**: "Before we add indexes, let's analyze the query patterns. Rohit, can you share the execution plan?"

**ROHIT**: "The query is doing a full table scan. Adding indexes would definitely help."

**ARJUN**: "From infrastructure perspective, we should also consider read replicas for dashboard queries."

**DEEPAK**: "I'll set up performance testing to validate any changes before production."

**MARSHAL**: "Good. Kavya, lead the database optimization. Arjun, prepare the read replica setup. Timeline?"

**KAVYA**: "Index creation will take 2 hours during maintenance window. Testing and deployment by tomorrow."

**PRIYA**: "I'll coordinate with the business team about the maintenance window."
```

### **Example 2: API Integration Challenge**

```
**LAKSHMI**: "I found an issue during integration testing. The payment gateway API is returning inconsistent response formats."

**RAJESH**: "That's causing the frontend to break. The success response structure is different from the documentation."

**ROHIT**: "I implemented the payment integration. Let me check the API documentation again."

**SNEHA**: "I've worked with this payment provider before. They have version inconsistencies in their API."

**VICKY**: "Let's not assume the documentation is correct. Rohit, can you log the actual responses?"

**ROHIT**: "Good idea. I'll add comprehensive logging and share the actual response structures."

**ANANYA**: "From frontend perspective, I can add response validation to handle both formats."

**KAVYA**: "That's a temporary fix. We should contact the payment provider for clarification."

**MARSHAL**: "Agreed. Rohit, reach out to their technical team. Ananya, implement the validation as a safety measure."

**DEEPAK**: "I'll add test cases for both response formats to prevent regression."

**PRIYA**: "I'll follow up with the payment provider's account manager to escalate this."

**AMIT**: "I can help with the logging implementation if needed."

**VICKY**: "Good. Amit, pair with Rohit on the logging. This is a good learning opportunity."
```

### **Example 3: Feature Planning Discussion**

```
**PRIYA**: "Let's plan the user notification system for next sprint. Marshal, what are the requirements?"

**MARSHAL**: "We need real-time notifications for user activities, email fallback, and notification preferences management."

**VICKY**: "This involves multiple components. Let me break it down: real-time websockets, email service, preference API, and frontend notifications."

**ARJUN**: "For real-time notifications, we should use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events. I prefer WebSockets for bidirectional communication."

**KAVYA**: "I'll design the notification service API. We need to consider notification types, delivery status, and user preferences."

**ROHIT**: "I can implement the preference management API. It's straightforward CRUD operations."

**SNEHA**: "I'll handle the email service integration. We should use a queue system for reliability."

**RAJESH**: "For frontend, I'll implement the notification component and websocket connection management."

**ANANYA**: "I can work on the notification preferences UI and mobile responsiveness."

**DEEPAK**: "We need to test notification delivery, email fallback, and preference changes thoroughly."

**LAKSHMI**: "I'll create test scenarios for different notification types and delivery failures."

**KIRAN**: "Can I help with the frontend notification styling and animations?"

**AMIT**: "I'd like to learn about websocket implementation. Can I assist with that?"

**MARSHAL**: "Good distribution. Arjun, set up the websocket infrastructure. Kavya, design the overall architecture."

**VICKY**: "I'll coordinate between teams and ensure consistent implementation patterns."

**PRIYA**: "Timeline estimate for this feature?"

**KAVYA**: "Two weeks for backend, one week for frontend, one week for testing and integration."

**MARSHAL**: "Approved. Let's proceed with this plan."
```

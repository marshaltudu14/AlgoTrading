Currently I am providing a lookback_window in environemnt to allow the model to look at past candle data as well. But apart from this, I also want the model to remember past action context, so that the models what action, direction, quantity, at which price etc etc to took, and this will allow the model to make better informed decision currently. And I want this action context to provide actions of the last 7 days only so that we store only relevant action information that are relevant to the market. This will help the model learn patterns like, "If last trade was a loss, don't immediately reverse at the same price."

Apart from historical candle data, I also want the model to see market depth as it will not just tell the model whether the candle closed in long or short, but it will also tell the model the forces which made the candle close, and it can help the model understand teh actual ask bid, quantity, price etc etc. But note that i don't have access to historical market depth and it is available only during live via socket tick by tick.

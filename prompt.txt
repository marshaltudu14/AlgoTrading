Apart from historical candle data, I also want the model to see market depth as it will not just tell the model whether the candle closed in long or short, but it will also tell the model the forces which made the candle close, and it can help the model understand teh actual ask bid, quantity, price etc etc. But note that i don't have access to historical market depth and it is available only during live via socket tick by tick.

I want to replace all ppo logic with decision transformers (offline RL) which I think will be more powerful
and perform better in algo trading. I want to replace and rename or maybe delete ppo logic and add decision
transformers code. The transforms will have input layer, embeddings since I will train the model on various 
instruments and timeframes, so instruments embeddings is a must, then transformers encoders, policy and value head.
I will use settings.yaml as the command center to decide how many attention layers I want, and I will feed
about 512 hsitorical data in each sequence to give a broad historical view to the model, allowing it make
better informed decisions. For attention, I want to use a combinaton of multi-head, casual attention as the base,
hierarchial attention for reasoning across multiple timeframes, memory based attention to not forget older signals.

# Developer Task Process Summary - July 15, 2025

## Session Overview

Today, we continued our task of building a supervised model for our algo trading bot. The primary focus was on addressing critical issues that arose during the initial model training and evaluation, particularly data leakage and performance bottlenecks.

### Key Challenges Addressed:

1.  **Data Leakage (100% Accuracy):** Initially, the model showed unrealistic 100% accuracy, indicating data leakage. This was traced back to the `signal` column (future-looking) directly influencing the `decision` column, and subsequently, the `reasoning` text (which was used as a feature).
2.  **Slow Training Time:** The model training was taking over 30 minutes for small datasets, which was unacceptable for future scalability.
3.  **`ImportError: No module named 'src'`:** An environment issue preventing the data processing pipeline from running correctly.
4.  **Class Imbalance:** After fixing initial leakage, the model showed severe class imbalance in the test set, leading to `ValueError` and `UndefinedMetricWarning`.

### Solutions Implemented:

1.  **Time-Series Data Split:** Implemented a chronological split for training and testing data to prevent future data from leaking into the training set.
2.  **Pre-computation and Caching of Hugging Face Embeddings:**
    *   Created `src/supervised_model/generate_embeddings.py` to pre-compute and save embeddings for the `reasoning` text.
    *   Integrated this embedding generation directly into `src/data_processing/pipeline.py` to streamline the process.
3.  **Redefinition of `decision` and `signal` columns:**
    *   Modified `src/reasoning_system/core/enhanced_orchestrator.py` to generate the `decision` column based on historically-derived rules (SMA, RSI, Bollinger Bands).
    *   The `signal` column is now a direct mapping of this historically-derived `decision`.
4.  **Historically-Pure `reasoning` Text Generation:** Refactored `src/reasoning_system/core/enhanced_orchestrator.py` to ensure the `reasoning` text is generated *only* from historical context, without any influence from future information or the `decision` itself.
5.  **Removal of Future-Looking `signal` Generation:** Removed the `generate_signals` method and its calls from `src/data_processing/feature_generator.py`.
6.  **`sys.path` Fix:** Corrected the `sys.path` manipulation in `src/data_processing/pipeline.py` to ensure proper module imports.

## Current Status

*   `src/reasoning_system/core/enhanced_orchestrator.py` is updated with historically-derived `decision` and `signal` generation, and historically-pure `reasoning` text generation.
*   `src/data_processing/feature_generator.py` is updated to remove future-looking `signal` generation.
*   `src/data_processing/pipeline.py` is updated to integrate embedding generation directly into the pipeline.
*   The `pipeline.py` has been successfully re-run, generating new clean data and embeddings. The training time has been significantly reduced.
*   `src/supervised_model/generate_embeddings.py` is now redundant as its functionality is integrated into `pipeline.py`.
*   The `model_pipeline.py` still needs to be updated to remove its internal Hugging Face model loading and embedding generation logic.
*   We are currently facing a severe class imbalance in the test set, which needs to be addressed by using a larger, aggregated dataset.

## Next Steps (for next session)

1.  **Rohit:** Delete the redundant script `src/supervised_model/generate_embeddings.py`.
2.  **Sneha:** Modify `src/supervised_model/model_pipeline.py`:
    *   Remove the Hugging Face model initialization and embedding generation logic from its `__init__` and `prepare_data` methods.
    *   It should now *only* load the pre-computed embeddings from `data/processed/embeddings/`.
3.  **Rohit & Sneha:** Aggregate all `final_*.csv` files from `data/final` into a single, larger DataFrame for training and testing. This is crucial to address the class imbalance.
4.  **Sneha & Deepak:** Re-train and re-evaluate the supervised model using this larger, aggregated, and clean dataset. Analyze the new, realistic performance metrics.
5.  **Priya:** Coordinate the aggregation of data and subsequent re-evaluation.

We will resume with these tasks tomorrow.
